# car_robot
Simple Car robot using RViz and Ros 1

Hope that you have installed Ros 1 and know how to create a workspace.

run `catkin_make` in the project directory
and then go to the src folder and create a package named `catkin_create_pkg car_robot && catkin_make`
then run `source devel/setup.bash` 
then run `roslaunch car-robot rviz.launch`
